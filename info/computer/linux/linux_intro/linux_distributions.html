                        what is a Linux distribution and how does it relate to the Linux kernel? <br><br>

                        We know that Linux kernel is the core of the operating system. <br><br>

                        A full Linux distribution consists of the kernel with addition of a number of other software
                        tools for
                        file-related operations, user management, and software package management.
                        Every tool provides a part of the complete system.
                        Each tool is often its own separate project, with its own developers working to perfect that
                        piece of the system. <br><br>

                        While the most recent Linux kernel (and earlier versions) can always be found in
                        <a href="https://www.kernel.org/" target="_blank"
                            style="text-decoration: none; color: darkcyan">The Linux Kernel Archives</a> ,
                        Linux distributions may be based on different kernel versions. <br><br>
                        For example, the very popular RHEL 8 distribution is based on the 4.18 kernel, which is not new,
                        but is extremely stable.
                        Other distributions may move more quickly in adopting the latest kernel releases. <br><br>
                        It is important to note that the kernel is not an all or nothing proposition,
                        for example, RHEL/CentOS have incorporated many of the more recent kernel improvements into
                        their older versions, as have Ubuntu, openSUSE, SLES, etc. <br><br>

                            alt="linux_distribution_roles"
                            style="width: 90%; height: 90%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
                        <br><br>

                        Examples of other essential tools and ingredients provided by distributions, include the C/C++
                        and C-lang compilers, the gdb debugger,
                        the core system libraries applications need to link with in order to run,
                        the low-level interface for drawing graphics on the screen,
                        as well as the higher-level desktop environment,
                        and the system for installing and updating the various components, including the kernel itself.
                        And all distributions come with a rather complete suite of applications already installed. <br>
