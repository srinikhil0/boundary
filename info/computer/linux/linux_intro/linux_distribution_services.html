                    <p>
                        There are vast variety of Linux distributions designed to serve to many different audiences and
                        organizations,
                        according to their specific needs and tastes. <br><br>
                        However, large organizations, such as companies and governmental institutions and other
                        entities,
                        tend to choose the major commercially-supported distributions from Red Hat, SUSE, and Canonical
                        (Ubuntu). <br><br>

                        CentOS and CentOS Stream are popular free (as in no cost) alternatives to Red Hat Enterprise
                        Linux (RHEL)
                        and are often used by organizations that are comfortable operating without paid technical
                        support. <br><br>
                        Ubuntu and Fedora are widely used by developers and are also popular in the educational realm.
                        <br><br>
                        Scientific Linux is favored by the scientific research community for its compatibility with
                        scientific and mathematical software packages. <br><br>
                        Both CentOS variants are binary-compatible with RHEL; i.e. in most cases, binary software
                        packages will install properly across the distributions. <br><br>

                        Note that CentOS is planned to disappear at the end of 2021 in favor of CentOS Stream.
                        However, there are at least two new RHEL-derived substitutes: Alma Linux and Rocky Linux which
                        are establishing a foothold. <br><br>

                        Many commercial distributors, including Red Hat, Ubuntu, SUSE, and Oracle, provide long term
                        fee-based support for their distributions,
                        as well as hardware and software certification. <br><br>
                        All major distributors provide update services for keeping your system primed with the latest
                        security and bug fixes,
                        and performance enhancements, as well as provide online support resources. <br><br>
