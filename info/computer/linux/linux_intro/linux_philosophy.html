                        Linux carry off heavily from the well-established UNIX operating system. It was written to be a
                        free and open source system to be used in place of UNIX, which at the time was designed for
                        computers much more powerful than PCs and was quite expensive.<br><br>
                        Files are stored in a hierarchical filesystem, with the top node of the system being the root or
                        simply "/". <br><br>
                        Whenever possible, Linux makes its components available via files or objects that look like
                        files.
                        Processes, devices, and network sockets are all represented by file-like objects, and can often
                        be worked with using the same utilities used for regular files. Linux is a fully multitasking
                        (i.e. multiple threads of execution are performed simultaneously), multiuser operating system,
                        with built-in networking and service processes known as daemons in the UNIX world.<br><br>
