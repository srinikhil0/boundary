                    <p>
                        All modern computers support <b>Suspend (or Sleep) Mode</b> when you want to stop using your
                        computer
                        for a while. <br><br>
                        Suspend Mode saves the current system state and allows you to resume your session
                        more quickly while remaining on, but uses very little power in the sleeping state. It works by
                        keeping your systemâ€™s applications, desktop, and so on, in system RAM, but turning off all of
                        the other hardware. This shortens the time for a full system start-up as well as conserves
                        battery power. One should note that modern Linux distributions actually boot so fast that the
                        amount of time saved is often minor. <br><br>
                        To suspend the system, the procedure starts the same as that for shutdown or locking the screen.
                        <br><br>
                        The method is quite simple and universal in most recent GNOME-based distributions. If you click
                        on the Power icon and hold for a short time and release, you will get the double line icon
                        displayed below, which you then click to suspend the system. Some distributions, including
                        Ubuntu, may still show a separate Suspend icon instead of using the above method. <br><br>
                    </p>
                    <div class="note">
                        <p>To wake your system and resume your session, move the mouse or press any button on the
                            keyboard. The system will wake up with the screen locked, just as if you had manually locked
                            it; type in your password to resume.</p> <br>
