                        GNOME is a popular desktop environment with an easy-to-use graphical user interface. It is
                        bundled as the default desktop environment for most Linux distributions, including Red Hat
                        Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Fedora, CentOS, SUSE Linux Enterprise, Ubuntu and Debian. GNOME has
                        menu-based navigation and is sometimes an easy transition to accomplish for Windows users.
                        However, as you will see, the look and feel can be quite different across distributions, even if
                        they are all using GNOME. <br>

                    <p>
                        Another common very important desktop environment in the history of Linux and also widely used
                        is KDE, which has often been used in conjunction with SUSE and openSUSE. Other alternatives for
                        a desktop environment include Unity (present on older Ubuntu, but still based on GNOME), XFCE
                        and LXDE. As previously mentioned, most desktop environments follow a similar structure to
                        GNOME, and we will restrict ourselves mostly to it to keep things less complex. <br><br>
