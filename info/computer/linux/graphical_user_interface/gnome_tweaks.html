                        Most common settings, both personal and system-wide, are to be found by clicking in the upper
                        right-hand corner, on either a gear or other obvious icon, depending on your Linux distribution.
                        <br><br>
                        However, there are many settings which many users would like to modify which are not thereby
                        accessible; the default settings utility is unfortunately rather limited in modern GNOME-based
                        distributions. Unfortunately, the quest for simplicity has actually made it difficult to adapt
                        your system to your tastes and needs. <br><br>
                        Fortunately, there is a standard utility, gnome-tweaks, which exposes many more setting options.
                        It also permits you to easily install extensions by external parties. Not all Linux
                        distributions install this tool by default, but it is always available (older distributions used
                        the name gnome-tweak-tool). You may have to run it by hitting Alt-F2 and then typing in the
                        name. <br><br>
                        some recent distributions have taken most of the functionality out of this tool and placed it in
                        a new one, called <b>gnome-extensions-app.</b> <br><br>
                        In the screenshot below, the keyboard mapping is being adjusted so the useless CapsLock key can
                        be used as an additional Ctrl key; this saves users who use Ctrl a lot (such as emacs
                        aficionados) from getting physically damaged by pinkie strain. <br><br>
