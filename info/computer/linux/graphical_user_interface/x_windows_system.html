                        Generally, in a Linux desktop system, the X Window System is loaded as one of the final steps in
                        the boot process. It is often just called X. <br><br>
                        A service called the Display Manager keeps track of the displays being provided and loads the X
                        server (so-called, because it provides graphical services to applications, sometimes called X
                        clients). The display manager also handles graphical logins and starts the appropriate desktop
                        environment after a user logs in. <br><br>
                        X is rather old software; it dates back to the mid 1980s and, as such, has certain deficiencies
                        on modern systems (for example, with security), as it has been stretched rather far from its
                        original purposes. A newer system, known as <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/"
                            target="_blank" style="color: darkcyan; text-decoration:none">Wayland</a>, is gradually
                        superseding it and
                        is the default display system for Fedora, RHEL 8, and other recent distributions. For the most
                        part, it
                        looks just like X to the user, although under the hood it is quite different. <br><br>

                        A desktop environment consists of a session manager, which starts and maintains the components
                        of the graphical session, and the window manager, which controls the placement and movement of
                        windows, window title-bars, and controls. <br><br>
                        Although these can be mixed, generally a set of utilities, session manager, and window manager
                        are used together as a unit, and together provide a seamless desktop environment. <br><br>
                        If the display manager is not started by default in the default runlevel, you can start the
                        graphical desktop different way, after logging on to a text-mode console, by running startx from
                        the command line. Or, you can start the display manager (gdm, lightdm, kdm, xdm, etc.) manually
                        from the command line. This differs from running startx as the display managers will project a
                        sign in screen.<br><br>
