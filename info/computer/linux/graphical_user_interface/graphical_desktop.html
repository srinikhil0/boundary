                        You can use either a Command Line Interface (CLI) or a Graphical User Interface (GUI) when using
                        Linux. To work at the CLI, you have to remember which programs and commands are used to perform
                        tasks, and how to quickly and accurately obtain more information about their use and options. On
                        the other hand, using the GUI is often quick and easy. It allows you to interact with your
                        system through graphical icons and screens. For repetitive tasks, the CLI is often more
                        efficient, while the GUI is easier to navigate if you do not remember all the details or do
                        something only rarely. <br><br>

                        We will learn how to manage sessions using the GUI for the three Linux distribution families.
                        Since we are using the GNOME-based variant of Linux (which is most popularly used) rather than the KDE-based
                        one, all are actually quite similar. If you are using KDE (or other Linux desktops such as
                        XFCE), your experience will vary somewhat, but not in any intrinsically
                        difficult way, as user interfaces have converged to certain well-known behaviors on modern
                        operating systems. In the upcoming sessions, we will concentrate in great detail on
                        the command line interface, which is pretty much the same on all distributions. <br><br>
