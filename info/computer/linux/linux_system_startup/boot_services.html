                        Once the kernel has set up all its hardware and mounted the root filesystem, the kernel runs
                        /sbin/init. This then becomes the initial process, which then starts other processes to get the
                        system running. <br><br> 
                        Most other processes on the system trace their origin ultimately to init;
                        exceptions include the so-called kernel processes. These are started by the kernel directly, and
                        their job is to manage internal operating system details. <br><br>
                        Besides starting the system, init is responsible for keeping the system running and for shutting
                        it down cleanly. <br><br>
                        One of its responsibilities is to act when necessary as a manager for all
                        non-kernel processes; it cleans up after them upon completion, and restarts user login services
                        as needed when users log in and out, and does the same for other background system services.

                        Traditionally, this process startup was done using conventions that date back to the 1980s and
                        the System V variety of UNIX. This serial process had the system passing through a sequence of
                        runlevels containing collections of scripts that start and stop services. Each runlevel
                        supported a different mode of running the system. Within each runlevel, individual services
                        could be set to run, or to be shut down if running. <br><br>
                        However, all major distributions have moved away from this sequential runlevel method of system
                        initialization, although they usually emulate many System V utilities for compatibility
                        purposes.<br>
