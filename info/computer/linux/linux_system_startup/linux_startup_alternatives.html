                        <b>SysVinit</b> viewed things as a serial process, divided into a series of sequential stages.
                        Each
                        stage required completion before the next could proceed. Thus, startup did not easily take
                        advantage of the parallel processing that could be done on multiple processors or cores.
                        <br><br>
                        Furthermore, shutdown and reboot was seen as a relatively rare event; exactly how long it took
                        was not considered important. This is no longer true, especially with mobile devices and
                        embedded Linux systems. Some modern methods, such as the use of containers, can require almost
                        instantaneous startup times. Thus, systems now require methods with faster and enhanced
                        capabilities. Finally, the older methods required rather complicated startup scripts, which were
                        difficult to keep universal across distribution versions, kernel versions, architectures, and
                        types of systems. <br><br>
                        The two main alternatives developed were: <br><br>
                        <b>UPSTART</b> <br>
                    </p>
                    <ul style="color: white; font-size: 20px;font-family: 'Merriweather';margin-left: 50px;">
                        <li>Developed by Ubuntu and first included in 2006</li>
                        <li>Adopted in Fedora 9 in 2008 and in RHEL 6 and its clones</li>
                    </ul> <br><br>
                    <p>
                        <b>SYSTEMD</b> <br>
                    <ul style="color: white; font-size: 20px;font-family: 'Merriweather';margin-left: 50px;">
                        <li>Adopted by Fedora first in 2011</li>
                        <li>Adopted by RHEL 7 and SUSE </li>
                        <li>Replaced Upstart in Ubuntu 16.04</li>
                    </ul> <br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While the migration to systemd was rather controversial, it has been adopted by all major
                        distributions, and so the older System V method or Upstart, which has become
                        a dead end. Regardless of how one feels about the controversies or the technical methods of
                        systemd, almost universal adoption has made learning how to work on Linux systems simpler, as
                        there are fewer differences among distributions.<br>
