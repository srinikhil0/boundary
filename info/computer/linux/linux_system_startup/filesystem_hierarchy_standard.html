                        Linux systems store their important files according to a standard layout called the Filesystem
                        Hierarchy Standard (FHS), which has long been maintained by the Linux Foundation. Having a
                        standard is designed to ensure that users, administrators, and
                        developers can move between distributions without having to re-learn how the system is
                        organized. <br><br>
                        Linux uses the ‘/’ character to separate paths (unlike Windows, which uses ‘\’), and does not
                        have drive letters. Multiple drives and/or partitions are mounted as directories in the single
                        filesystem. Removable media such as USB drives and CDs and DVDs will show up as mounted at
                        <code>/run/media/yourusername/disklabel</code> for recent Linux
                        systems, or under <code>/media</code> for older distributions. <br><br>

                    </figure><br><br>

                    <p>
                        All Linux filesystem names are case-sensitive, so /boot, /Boot, and /BOOT represent three
                        different directories (or folders). Many distributions differentiate between core utilities needed
                        for proper system operation and other programs, and place the latter in directories under /usr
                        (think user). To get a sense for how the other programs are organized, find the /usr directory
                        in the above figure represented and compare the subdirectories with those that exist
                        directly under the system root directory (/). <br><br>

                        To discuss about file hierarchy, for example, if you are a under-grad student in a university
                        and your student code is 36110419,
                        if you want to go to see your documents, then you need to go to the ‘root’ (/),
                        then you are able to see a variety of directories which includes ‘home’, ‘tmp’, ‘usr’, ‘var’
                        directories, out of which the ‘home’ directory will have all the stored general media files.
                        From there you need to pass through ‘students’ -> ug -> 2016 -> CSE -> 36110419. Here you can see your
                        respective accessed files/folders. <br><br>
                        To be in technical way of representation the following is the directory
                        structure in linux
                        <code>/home/students/ug/2016/CSE/36110419/</code>, and
                        a file you want to acess is report.docx on that disc would be at
                        <code>/home/students/ug/2016/CSE/36110419/report.docx</code>.
