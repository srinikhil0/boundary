                        The boot loader has two prominent stages: <br><br>

                        For systems using the BIOS/MBR method, the boot loader resides at the first sector of the hard
                        disk, also known as the Master Boot Record (MBR). The size of the MBR is just 512 bytes. In this
                        stage, the boot loader examines the partition table and finds a bootable partition. Once it
                        finds a bootable partition, it then searches for the second stage boot loader. <br><br>
                        For example GRUB,
                        and loads it into RAM (Random Access Memory). For systems using the EFI/UEFI method, UEFI
                        firmware reads its Boot Manager data to determine which UEFI application is to be launched and
                        from where (i.e. from which disk and partition the EFI partition can be found). The firmware
                        then launches the UEFI application, for example GRUB, as defined in the boot entry in the
                        firmware's boot manager. This procedure is more complicated, but more versatile than the older
                        MBR methods. <br><br>

                        The second stage boot loader resides under /boot. A splash screen is displayed, which allows us
                        to choose which operating system (OS) to boot. After choosing the OS, the boot loader loads the
                        kernel of the selected operating system into RAM and passes control to it. Kernels are almost
                        always compressed, so its first job is to uncompress itself. After this, it will check and
                        analyze the system hardware and initialize any hardware device drivers built into the kernel. <br>
